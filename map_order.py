"""Question:
Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop. It works on a list with sublists, which look like this: 

Order Num.	Book Title and Author	    Quantity	   Price per Item
34587	Learning Python, Mark Lutz		4		40.95
98762	Programming Python, Mark Lutz		5		56.80
77226	Head First Python, Paul Barry		3		32.95
88112	EinfÃ¼hrung in Python3, Bernd Klein	3		24.99


Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of a the order number and the product of the price per items and the quantity. The product should be increased by 10,- € if the value of the order is less than 100,00 €. 
Write a Python program using lambda and map."""

	       ["98762", "Programming Python, Mark Lutz", 5, 56.80], 
           ["77226", "Head First Python, Paul Barry", 3,32.95],
           ["88112", "EinfÃ¼hrung in Python3, Bernd Klein", 3, 24.99]]

				       else (x[0], x[1] + 10), 
	      	 map(lambda x: (x[0],x[2] * x[3]), orders)))
print(invoice_totals)
